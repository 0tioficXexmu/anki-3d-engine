# Flowcode Pic Professional: A Visual Programming Language for Microcontrollers
 
Flowcode Pic Professional is a software tool that allows you to create complex electronic and electromechanical systems using Microchip PIC microcontrollers. Flowcode Pic Professional is ideal for commercial engineers who want to program using graphical icons instead of writing code. Flowcode Pic Professional also supports Bluetooth, CAN bus, ZigBee and other communication protocols. You can test and debug your code using Ghost Technology, which simulates the hardware behavior in real time. You can also create your own components and use them in your projects.
